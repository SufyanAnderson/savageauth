# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, EJS, Express, Passport
This project took HTML, CSS, EJS, and express to get the desired result. 
# Lessons Learned
This was one of my first exposures to developing on the back end. Alot of valuable debugging came from this
and showed me how to interact with DOM through the server. This was also one of my first experience working with
authentication and users. I learned alot more about routes and gain some knowledge on passport as well.
